    <h2>Research Focus</h2>
    <p>As a PhD student in Health Econometrics, my research focuses on the application of <strong>structural modeling</strong>, <strong>causal inference and identification issues</strong>, and <strong>microeconometrics</strong>. I have a particular interest in policy evaluation, with a passion for the theoretical aspects of econometrics and its applications in health and population economics.</p>

    <h2>Current Research Projects</h2>
    <p>I am currently working on several exciting research projects that combine innovative econometric techniques with real-world health and policy issues:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Formal and Informal Care: Substitutes or Complements?</strong> (with Liliane Bonnal and Pascal Favard) – Investigating the relationship between formal and informal care for elderly populations and its impact on health outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Maternal Health Behaviors, Sexual and Reproductive Experiences, and Full Vaccination Coverage: Causal or Not?</strong> – A study using a control function and copula-free IV two-stage approach to analyze the causal relationships between maternal health behaviors and vaccination coverage.</li>
      <li><strong>Formal Care, Informal Care, and Mental Health of the Elderly in Europe: A Structural Causal Approach</strong> – Examining the causal relationship between formal and informal care and its effects on the mental health of elderly individuals across Europe.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These projects apply cutting-edge econometric techniques to assess the impact of health policies, caregiving arrangements, and maternal health behaviors on individual and societal well-being. The aim is to better inform policy decisions that improve health outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations.</p>
